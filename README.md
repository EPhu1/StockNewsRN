# StockNewsRN

Hello! I made this app so that I could take a quick look at some of the stocks that I keep watch of. This application is useful to see the prices of certain stocks 
over a period of time as well revelevant news articles. I used News API and Alpha Vantage API to  gather all the data. I then used victory graph for simple
data visualization.
